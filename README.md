cocos2d-js-rapidgame-template
=============================

Rapidgame template for standard cocos2d-js v3.0 RC0

With this game template you can make games with cocos2d-js much easier. The original source of [RapidGame](https://github.com/NatWeiss/RapidGame "") (in the lib folder) was overwritten a little bit to work with the standard hierarchy of a cocos2d-js project. To use this template simply make a directory:
> cocos2d-js-v3.0-rc0/templates/js-template-rapidgame

and copy the repo's content into this directory..

Then you can create new projects easily:
```bash
cocos new ProjectName -l js -t rapidgame
```
